Documentation:

Design pattern : MVVM
Binding technique : ServiceLocator class 
Applied principle : IOC 

RequireReferenceAttribute
this is a serialized field attribute that is marking the field as [RequireReference]
which means that if the field is empty an icon will be drawn in unity inspector 
and in the hierarchy making it easy to spot missing references 
and avoid discovering missing references in playmode

ServiceLocator
So here comes the controversial part: i used DI in non monoBehaviour classes via constructor
and all the monoBehaviour classes are resolving their dependency on Awake via ServiceLocator

ReactiveProperty
nice way to make the view update when value in viewModel is changes
